Step 1: Set up the login page

Create a login page that accepts username and password or email and password.
Use Basic authentication with base64 encoding to send the credentials to the signin endpoint.
Handle errors and display an error message if the credentials are invalid.
Store the JWT token in local storage or a secure cookie.
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Step 2: Create a GraphQL client

Use a GraphQL client library such as Apollo Client or GraphQL-Request to make queries to the GraphQL endpoint.
Set up the client to use the JWT token for authentication.
Step 3: Query the GraphQL endpoint

Use the GraphQL client to query the user table and retrieve the user's data.
Use the user query to retrieve the user's id, login, and other relevant information.
Use the object query to retrieve information about objects (exercises/projects).
Use the result query to retrieve information about the user's results.
Step 4: Create the profile page

Use a UI framework such as React or Angular to create the profile page.
Display the user's data retrieved from the GraphQL endpoint.
Create sections for basic user identification, XP amount, grades, audits, and skills.
Create a statistic section that displays graphs using SVG.
Step 5: Implement graph generation

Use a library such as D3.js to generate SVG graphs.
Create at least two different statistic graphs for the data given.
Use the principles of good UI design to make the graphs interactive and visually appealing.
Step 6: Host the profile page

Choose a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.
Deploy the profile page to the hosting platform.
Step 7: Test and iterate

Test the profile page to ensure that it works as expected.
Iterate on the design and functionality based on user feedback.
